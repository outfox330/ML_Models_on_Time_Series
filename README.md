# ML Models on Time Series
Fun explorations for ML models on Time Series Datasets (Inertial sensors, among others)

## 1. TCN (Temporal Convolutions Network)
We increase the receptive field of convolution layers using dilation. Convolutions don't use the future inputs to make it usable in real-time settings, so it is causal. The folder contains working examples to show this in practice. How to find optimal hyperparameters; I will add a working state-of-the-art Mango code for this in the future.
